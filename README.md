# PyNES
## A simple NES Emulator written in Python
The goal of this project is to teach me how to write emulators, and everything that goes with it.
## Architecture
In order to emulate a NES console, the idea is to emulate each of the internal components and then make them work together.

These components include:
+ CPU 
+ Bus
+ PPU
+ Memory
+ I/O

## Dependencies
I'm using _unittest_ for tests, and _numpy_ for more efficient data types,
