# PyNES
## A simple NES Emulator written in Python
The goal of this project is to teach me how to write emulators, and everything that goes with it.
Meaning, this project is primarily for educational purposes.
## Architecture
In order to emulate a NES console, my idea is to emulate each of the internal components and then somehow make them work together.

These components include:
+ CPU
+ PPU
+ Memory
+ I/O
